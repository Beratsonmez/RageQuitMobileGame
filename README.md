# RageQuit

RageQuit is a 2D mobile platform game that I developed with a team of two. Inspired by "Soulslike"
games, our aim was to punish players for their mistakes and convince them that they could easily
lose the progress they made, encouraging them to focus more on the game. During the level design
phase, we created situations where the player would uncontrollably fall and lose a significant portion
of their progress if they made any mistake. We believed that this would motivate the player to
overcome previously cleared obstacles easily, get more excited about discovering new areas, and
prove to themselves that they could improve their skills beyond their previous level.
